Coding Practice Analytics and Pattern Tracker

This project is a full stack web application designed to help users track their coding practice and understand their learning progress through structured analytics.

The motivation behind this project comes from the observation that many learners solve coding problems regularly but do not have a clear understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, or improvement patterns. Most platforms focus on problem solving itself, but provide limited insight into how a learner is progressing conceptually.

This system focuses on collecting coding practice data and converting it into meaningful insights such as topic wise accuracy, pattern based performance, consistency over time, and difficulty level trends. The goal is to help users reflect on their preparation and identify areas that require more focused practice.

This project is not intended to replace existing coding platforms. Instead, it acts as a personal analytics layer built on top of coding practice data for learning and analysis purposes.

The main objective of this project is to store coding practice information in a structured relational database and use that data to analyze performance across topics, problem solving patterns, and difficulty levels. The system is designed to help users identify weak areas, monitor improvement, and build a better understanding of how they approach problem solving.

The backend of the project is built using FastAPI with PostgreSQL as the database and SQLAlchemy as the ORM. The frontend is built using React and focuses on presenting analytics and insights through a simple dashboard.

The project is currently under active development. Initial work focuses on database design, backend APIs, and analytics logic. Frontend integration and visualization will be added after the core functionality is completed.
